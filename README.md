# Climate Change

This is my first Milestone Project. I have decided to go with the theme Climate Change, as this is an ongoing issue right now and people need to be aware of this and need to make a difference to the world. 

UX

* I would like the user to easily access my website and gain the knowledge about Climate Change in a few details instead of having a lot of information. I have kept it small, neat and minimal. 

Features
Existing Features 
I have split my website into 3 different section which are:

* About - This gives an explanaion around the issue of Climate change, with some images to make the section stand out.

* Media - There is a small description about the Media and a Ted Talk Youtube video underneath the writing to explain how crucial Climate Change is.

* Facts - I have provided a few facts to edcuate the user who may not understand.

Technologies used throughout the Projects 
There are vairous sites I have used to help me with my projects which are:
1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), this is used to structure my website and input all the text and images onto it, ]Code institute] (https://codeinstitute.net/) as well as Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn) were both very useful. 
2. CSS (Cascading Styles Sheets), this is used to style my website, such as the text, position of the image/ videos, colour, structure etc, I used Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn) as well as W3Schools (https://www.w3schools.com/)
3. Bootstrap, this is a CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile first front end development.(https://getbootstrap.com/)
4. Gitpod, is a frictionless coding, where you can code in a brower tab.(https://www.gitpod.io/)
5. There were times where I used Youtube as I understand it more when I am watching someone create their own and explaining as they are doing it. 

Testing
There are numerous ways where you can text you codes such as:
* Using Google Chrome by resizing the page to see if it is responsive.
* Using mobile phone to see how it appears on the screen.
* Using Validator, to see if my HTML code is correct. (https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
* Using W3C, to test my CSS. (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

Media 
I used a few website to get my Background cover as well as the small images that are used in the project.

* I used (https://www.pexels.com/) for my background cover. 
* I used (https://fontawesome.com/) for my Icons used throughout the project. 
* I used (https://fonts.google.com/) for the font style in my project.
